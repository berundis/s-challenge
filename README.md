## Sheridan CodeChallenge

To load this app run the following comands in your terminal
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Description

This app was developed with React.Js and was created with the global command-line utility `create-react-app`.
A wire frame was provided to use as reference to develop the homepage.  
Most of the logic is found in the Home folder; path: sheridan/src/components/Home

Flaws with design:
* CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT button appears twice within a small portion of the page.

Misunderstandings with design:
* In the Navigation Bar there are links to MyWebNow and Home. Don't know if they are different pages and that is why I did not linked MyWebNow to anything.
* With the arrow with the green background pointing down; it was not specified if this button should hide a part of the page or not. This button doesn't do anything right now.
